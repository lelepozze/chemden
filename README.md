# chemden

This space is used to store my notes from university. I study chemistry at [Universit√† degli Studi di Padova](https://www.unipd.it/).
I'm developing a new way to take notes, with LaTeX.
My main goal is to finish the remaining notes using LaTeX, and to rewrite my already taken notes, also using LaTeX.

For now I complete one course, the remaining are below
- [x] Chimica Analitica 2
- [ ] Chimica Biologica
- [ ] Chimica Fisica 1
- [ ] Chimica Farmaceutica
- [ ] Fisica
- [x] Chimica Organica 3 (partial)

Also, this is a list of notes that I want to remake
- [ ] Chimica degli Alimenti
- [ ] Chimica Fisica 3
- [ ] Chimica Inorganica 2 - Sistematica
- [ ] Chimica Inorganica 2 - Teoria
- [ ] Chimica Inorganica 1
- [ ] Industria Chimica

In the future, I want to create some guides/books to teach LaTeX and Python, but, before that, I need to learn those topics.
For now, I leave a list to make sure that I will not forget in the future.
- [ ] TeX & LaTeX
- [ ] Python

## LaTeX Resources
I'm also uploading my LaTeX files for repeat my work, if is necessary.
